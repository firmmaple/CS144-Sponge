//! \brief An in-order byte stream.

//! Bytes are written on the "input" side and read from the "output"
//! side.  The byte stream is finite: the writer can end the input,
//! and then no more bytes can be written.
class ByteStream {
  private:
    // Your code here -- add private members as necessary.
    // Use Circular Queue to implement ByteStream
    // Because we can't use _head ==_tail to determine whether _buf is empty or full,
    // it is necessary to use a additional variable _size to indicate it.
    std::vector<char> _buf;     // Internal buffer to store bytes
    size_t _head = 0;           // _buf[_head] is the first bytes
    size_t _tail = 0;           // _buf[_tail-1] is the last bytes
    size_t _size = 0;           // Number of currently stored bytes
    size_t _capacity;           // Max capacity of the _buf
    size_t _read_cnt = 0;       // Number of totally read bytes
    size_t _write_cnt = 0;      // Number of totally writed bytes
    bool _input_ended = false;  // Flag indicating that the input has ended
    bool _error = false;        //!< Flag indicating that the stream suffered an error.

    // Hint: This doesn't need to be a sophisticated data structure at
    // all, but if any of your tests are taking longer than a second,
    // that's a sign that you probably want to keep exploring
    // different approaches.
